                          <p class="highlight">We were using Kubernetes which had become burdensome both in terms of maintenance effort and cost, so we switched to AWS Lambda.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">The existing system used Flutter, but based on current team members&#x27; skill sets and recruitment market research, we decided to use ReactNative.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">As existing members were busy with other projects, we hired new members and got them contributing immediately as effective team members through an automated onboarding process.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">In this team, we recruited excellent members through team referrals rather than my own. Out of over 30 people who helped over nearly 3 years, only 2 members left voluntarily - one to start a business and another to care for family. This suggests team members are satisfied with the current development team environment.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">When some roles became difficult to fill using existing methods and traditional approaches showed signs of stagnation, we first hired assistants to strengthen our engineering recruitment system. This initiative was successful, leading to 4 excellent candidates among over 30 applicants, successfully strengthening the team.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">While there aren&#x27;t many technical challenges due to the nature of the product, schedules are tight so we continue to minimize non-implementation time to manage this.</p>

                          <p class="highlight">Progressed from R&amp;D results to product development, moving to full-scale implementation based on business requirements.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Separated the system architecture into a data and process management system and an AI-focused system to avoid using type-unsafe Python in parts that should be programmatically controlled, ensuring more stable programming.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Built a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda as the execution environment due to the product requiring simultaneous processing of thousands of requests.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Implemented custom queue execution to overcome scaling limitations when the number of Lambda functions executable from SQS reached its limit, despite Lambda&#x27;s individual limits not being an issue.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Frequently evaluated various models and switched to better performing ones as LLM options increased with monthly improvements in AI performance and cost reductions.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Built an automated, asynchronous management system to handle increased management overhead as successful recruitment grew the team to around 16 members.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Established a fully remote, flexible work hours system without regular meetings, implementing goal sharing, priority decision rules, and engineer performance evaluation systems that reduced daily management time to about 2.5 hours. Still working on improvements targeting under 1 hour.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Introduced a daily evaluation system that revealed previously undetectable issues, enabling problem detection and resolution by the next day despite the fully flexible environment.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Accurate individual engineer performance evaluation enabled quantitative assessment for rate adjustments (increases or decreases) and team composition decisions. I feel resulting in an estimated doubling of team cost efficiency.</p>

                            <strong>Remote Full-stack Engineer &amp; Engineering Manager</strong>
                            at <strong>AI Product R&amp;D Startup</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Python3, OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Llama, ChromeExtension, Selenium, PyAutoGUI, AutoGen</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Implemented internal tools leveraging improved LLM (Large Language Models) accuracy. Built autonomous systems aimed at executing tasks typically performed by new employees. Initially, when tasks exceeded 3-4 steps, LLMs would forget necessary operations or perform unintended actions. Resolved this by optimizing LLM specifications and task structures. Currently achieving over 90% success rate for tested tasks.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Improved LLM task execution stability by breaking down tasks into smaller components and providing examples, after identifying common error patterns based on task characteristics.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Modified the system to work with APIs from OpenAI and two other major AI companies simultaneously. Structured certain tasks to utilize more cost-effective or faster LLMs. Investigated and implemented multi-agent frameworks to handle complex tasks with autonomous correction capabilities. The multi-AI agent architecture enables autonomous behavior for complex scenarios, resulting in more versatile and reliable solutions.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Led a 4-person team, initially struggling with task distribution. The project started with limited AI expertise across the team, requiring extensive research while under pressure to deliver quick results. Implemented agile systems for the remote team, accommodating members across different countries and time zones.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Enhanced tool demonstrations for potential clients and investors by adding intuitive displays showing AI thought processes and actions, addressing initial uncanny behavior. Implemented configurable settings to toggle explanatory animations and displays to optimize performance.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Explored OS-level computer control functionality, including investigating the ability to interpret visual information for task operations. Various approaches were tested, but single LLM solutions proved inadequate for visual instruction interpretation. Multimodal approaches showed better results but still struggled with pixel-precise click location accuracy. Combined with existing research, showing only 20% accuracy, led to exploring alternative approaches.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Currently investigating methods similar to retail product and origin recognition systems observed 5-6 years ago, collaborating with domain experts. While browser control constitutes most tasks, development focus remains on web interface manipulation due to current instability in image-based instruction.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Experimented with an OSS Chrome extension capable of handling 3-step tasks, but discontinued development due to high integration costs with existing successful implementations.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Implemented multiple strategies to reduce token count while preserving essential information, addressing prompt token limits.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Initially achieved 60-70% success rate with source code generation for automated operations. Improved to nearly 100% by implementing AI-friendly wrapper functions with programmatic internal processing.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Dedicated time to testing new LLMs, frameworks, and products in a rapidly evolving landscape. Team development led to peak costs of ¥10,000 per hour, prompting investigation into open-source LLMs and newer options like Grok for cost and speed optimization.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Currently working on restructuring tasks for smaller LLMs, as simple replacement of expensive/slow LLMs failed. Found success with further task decomposition, planning structural modifications for the next phase to enable finer task granularity.</p>

                            <strong>Technical Advisor</strong>
                            at <strong>Manufacturing Industry SaaS Startup</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Team Development Management, Recruitment Support, Technical Debt Resolution, Organizational Structure Improvement</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Provided support to a newly appointed leader who was struggling with direction after the previous manager&#x27;s departure.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Started from a challenging position where even brief 10-minute conversations revealed numerous organizational and technical issues cascading continuously, indicating high stress levels.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Addressed the leader&#x27;s scattered thinking by helping systematically identify and evaluate all challenges regardless of size or category, prioritizing them by importance and urgency. After this exercise, we focused on the most critical issues to create a clear path forward.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Conducted regular online meetings to assess progress and plan next steps. My role was primarily asking questions, allowing the leader to do all the analysis and decision-making. After about three meetings, the leader gained confidence and momentum, making this support structure unnecessary.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">As immediate issues were being resolved, we noticed emerging anxiety about long-term direction. Started an initiative to identify what information would help clarify future actions. Also considered what information would help the CEO&#x27;s decision-making if needed. After adjusting communication between the leader and CEO, within about 2 months, the annual planning became clearer and the leader&#x27;s uncertainty noticeably decreased.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Once long-term direction was established, the next challenge was task volume exceeding capacity. Recruitment was ongoing but applications were low, causing about a month&#x27;s delay in planned team expansion. Developed plans to broaden recruitment efforts and secure internal resources. Implemented more proactive recruitment strategies beyond just free job boards, successfully securing multiple quality team members.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Addressed the issue of the leader lacking time for strategic work due to being overwhelmed with immediate tasks and unable to address long-term challenges.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Analysis of the leader&#x27;s time allocation revealed excessive manual work on tasks that could be automated, and time spent preparing work to make it easier for team members. As team members developed, we expanded their responsibilities and communication channels, enabling the leader to dedicate 50% of time to future initiatives.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">As the team grew, self-management became a challenge. Included management team members in meetings to discuss and implement structural improvements. This resulted in stable team control under managers.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Modified meeting structure to include technically-oriented members to help address technical debt that the leader had been handling alone since joining.</p>
                          <p class="highlight">Aimed for team self-direction without top-down leadership by starting with the same process of issue identification and evaluation we initially did with the leader. Through discussions, team members and leader aligned on values and problem recognition, resolving initial challenges within 3 weeks while broadening team perspective. Currently continuing discussions with the same members for further improvements.</p>
